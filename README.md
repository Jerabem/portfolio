# Portfolio 


## Creating  

In creating this portfolio, I wanted to ensure a clean design that looked good across all screen sizes. I also wanted to keep everything on a single page and break up the section using alternating background colours. This design was adapted from a live PDF portfolio created for another project. My challenge was to keep the essence of that original design while updating navigation and menu to reflect the web medium vs pdf document. Additionally, I opted to code it from scratch and use flex box as efficiently as possible to achieve the desired layout. 


## Challenges  

The intentionally cropped text in my design meant that the title did not suit using text as originally planned I had to find a work around and use a precisely cropped photo to achieve the design requirements. Creating a single page site was a first for me so I had to find ways of making what I knew how to do work to fit my layout. Using a combination of flex and margin percentages and a bunch of trial and error I was able to ensure the look of each section remained consistent across all devices. Lastly the font choice was a bit difficult to source but I found a hosting site for it that was free for commercial use. 
 

## Learning  

During the midterm I worked from the desktop layout back to the mobile layout (I know that was stupid!). I learned a few things from that challenging experience and led with mobile using min-width for media queries. I also tried to simplify my code as much as possible and reduce redundancies. To accomplish this, I used universal traits for all images, headings and other global
